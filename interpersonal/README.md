The higher you go, the more important interpersonal skills are. You need to have a solid technical background but at a certain point, you are making less of the technical decisions and your job becomes more and more about communicating. If people around you find you hard to work with, or annoying, or rude then this becomes more of a hindrance.

## Feedback

Need to solicit honest feedback on how you are doing as a leader. 360 degree anonymous feedback is one way to do this. Use this to understand where you can improve.

This book [What Got You Here Won't Get You There](https://www.amazon.com/What-Got-Here-Wont-There/dp/1846681375)  has some great ideas

One of these is "Feed Forward": 

Once you know an area you want to improve, tell a direct report "I want to improve at X"

Then ask them to give you 2 ideas for how you can improve at this. Afterwards it's important to advertise that you are trying to change this and follow up to ask how you are doing over time.


## Difficult Conversations

Gaving honest + sometimes hard conversations is an important part of leadership. At a certain point, nobody is going to do this for you, luckily it is a skill you can practice

[Diffcult Conversations](https://www.amazon.com/Difficult-Conversations-Discuss-What-Matters/dp/0143118447) is the book I have found most useful in developing these skills.

The summary that I have in my head:
- everyone is the hero of their own story, people always have their own motivations and justifications for their behavior
- for a conversation to be productive, you have to be curious and open to learning the story from the other persons POV
- it's important to be able to talk about feelings, nobody can deny how you feel vs debating the minutae of what happened
- relate these feelings back to your own identity, this gives the other person deep insight into how you work
    - e.g. "I think the reason this got under my skin is that I'm the sort of person that ..."


## Change Management

This sounds like a consultant's euphimism but thinking about how we introduce changes is important because it can make people very anxious and demotivated

**SCARF model**

humans respond to rewards + go into threat mode if these are threatened
we can use this model to think about how people in our team respond to changes
e.g. perceived threats to status or certainty produce a negative reaction

[Some more info here.](https://childcareta.acf.hhs.gov/systemsbuilding/systems-guides/leadership/leading-ourselves/scarf-model)

we want to be on the positive side of rewarding

(TODO add table here)
