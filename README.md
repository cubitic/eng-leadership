# Engineering Leadership

## What is engineering leadership?

I think this can mean different things depending on stage of career + responsibilities. Following [The Manager's Path](https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897/), I'll break it up into 4 main areas, and organise material for each separately:


- **[MANAGING PEOPLE](people)** 
    - making indivudals more effective
    - understanding what they need to be motivated as individuals
    - providing feedback, guidance, career growth.

- **[MANAGING TEAMS](teams)**
    - making a team productive
    - understanding + keeping team focussed on objectives
    - making sure deliverables are met
    - partnering with product

- **[MANAGING MULTIPLE TEAMS](multiple_teams)** 
    - responsible for organization techinical competence
    - guide and grow this competence
    - ensure code produced matches product needs + architecture can scale
    - review + refine processes. hiring + headcount planning
    - developing culture
    
- **[MANAGING MANAGERS](managers)**: 
    - making effective managers
    - hiring managers
    - holding managers accountable
 

## Interpersonal SKills

At all of these steps, interpersonal skills are important, much more than for an IC.
