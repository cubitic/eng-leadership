 the higher you go, the more important this is
 need to solicit honest feedback
 "what got you here won't get you there". 
 feedforward idea: I want to improve at X, give me 2 ideas
 advertise + follow-up: I want to improve at X. ask how you are doing
 

 having honest + sometimes hard conversations is important and a skill you can practice
 important to be able to talk about feelings
 difficult conversations book very useful

SCARF model
humans respond to rewards + go into threat mode if these are threatened
we can use this model to think about how people in our team respond to changes
e.g. perceived threats to status or certainty produce a negative reaction
