## What is Agile?

A set of methodlogies that help software teams be more effective and efficient.

Addresses all areas of traditional development:

- project management
- software design
- process improvement

It is also a mindset/philosophy that seeks to:

- open up planning/design/decision making to whole team, so everyone has a say

The Agile Manifesto describes this philosophy:

>We are uncovering better ways of developing
>software by doing it and helping others do it.
>Through this work we have come to value:
>
>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
>Working software over comprehensive documentation
>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
>Responding to change over following a plan
>
>That is, while there is value in the items on
>the right, we value the items on the left more.

These principles are more important than the practices. 
There is some benefit to just adopting the practices (standups, retros etc)
but deep change needs to be based on the principles.

Some notes on each principle:


### Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

Focus on individuals on the team + how they communicate, this is more important than process and specific tools.

Individuals have to understand why each process exists + be bought into it for the process to be adopted effectively.

Each team is different + will require a different approach, different processes.

Daily standups + retrospectives are based on this principle: this gives everyone a chance to talk about what is and isn't working, adapting the process to the individuals and figuring out how we have beeter interactions.

### Working software over comprehensive documentation

Delivering software that does what users need is more important than documentation that describes it.

Working software = software that delivers value e.g. makes more additional revenue than it cost to produce

Test driven development is based on this principle: the tests tell us that the software works as expected and also serves as documentation of what it does, that lives in the same codebase

### Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

This sounds like it only applies to customer-facing interaction but also describes interactions between teams.

Rather than define tight SLAs and specifications that are then handed to an engineering team, all stakeholders should be involved in the process and collaborate as a team.

e.g. product managers should be part of the team and involved in adapting to changes

### Responding to change over following a plan

Plans become inaccurate and inappropriate as projects progress and situations change.

Rather than follow a pre-written plan blindly, the team should adapt the work to fit changes and deliver software thatr works given those changes.

Task boards that are owned by the full team, to which any team member can add or edit items (e.g. JIRA) are based on this principle


## Why do we use agile?

Promised benefits of agile:

- projects delivered on time
- high-quality software
- maintainable code
- **most important**: better work-life balance => happier teams
