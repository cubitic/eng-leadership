# What is Agile?

A set of methodlogies (scrum, xp etc) that help software teams be more effective and efficient.

Addresses all areas of traditional development:

- project management
- software design
- process improvement

It is also a mindset/philosophy that seeks to:

- open up planning/design/decision making to whole team, so everyone has a say

# Agile Methodologies

An agile methodology is a set of "ready to use" practices that you can adopt together to get started with agile. These are like tried and tested recipes that you can start using that reflect the agile mindset.

Importantly though, unless you take the time as a team to understand the mindset and commit to it, you will not get the full benefit, since the team needs to understand the mindset and justification behind each practice for it to be embraced (i.e. to not be seen as pointless)

Popular agile methodologies are:

- Scrum
    - this is probably the most popular and the one I have used most
    - notes on Scrum [here](scrum.md)
- XP
- Lean    (technically not an agile methodology but in the same vein)
- Kanban  (technically not an agile methodology but in the same vein)

# 4 Values of Agile

The Agile Manifesto describes 4 key values that describe the agile mindset:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

https://agilemanifesto.org/

**These values are more important than the practices.**

There is some benefit to just adopting the practices (standups, retros etc)
but deep change needs to be based on changing the mindset of the team. The team needs to understand the purpose behind each practice for it to be adopted enthusiastically. The 4 values can explain that purpose.

Some notes on each value:

## Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

Focus on individuals on the team + how they communicate, this is more important than process and specific tools.

Individuals have to understand why each process exists + be bought into it for the process to be adopted effectively.

Each team is different + will require a different approach, different processes.

**Daily standups + retrospectives** are based on this value: they give everyone a chance to talk about what is and isn't working, adapting the process to the individuals and figuring out how we have better interactions.


## Working software over comprehensive documentation

Delivering software that does what users need is more important than documentation that describes it.

Working software = software that delivers value e.g. makes more additional revenue than it cost to produce


**Test driven development** is based on this principle: the tests tell us that the software works as expected and also serves as documentation of what it does, that lives in the same codebase


## Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

This sounds like it only applies to customer-facing interaction but also describes interactions between teams.

Rather than define tight SLAs and specifications that are then handed to an engineering team, all stakeholders should be involved in the process and collaborate as a team. Also applies to interactions between engineering teams.

e.g. product managers should be part of the team and involved in adapting to changes


## Responding to change over following a plan

Plans become inaccurate and inappropriate as projects progress and situations change.

Rather than follow a pre-written plan blindly, the team should adapt the work to fit changes and deliver software thatr works given those changes.

**Task boards** that are owned by the full team, to which any team member can add or edit items (e.g. JIRA) are based on this principle



# Why do we use agile?

Promised benefits of agile:

- projects delivered on time
- high-quality software
- maintainable code
- **most important**: better work-life balance => happier teams


# 12 Principles of Agile

In addition to the famous 4 Values described above, there are also 12 principles that emerge from the values. 

These 12 principles are more specific ideas of how to work that are based on the values and can be divided into 4 areas:
- Delivery
- Working Together
- Execution
- Improving

| Area | Principle | Notes |
| ---- | --------- | ----- |
| Delivery | Deliver valuable software continuously | Continuous delivery is an iterative process. Deliver partly-complete software early and get feedback. Pick highest value pieces to deliver first. |
| Delivery | Welcome changing requirements | Important that nobody is blamed when requirements change. Everyone is responsible for requirements. Changes are normal and responding to them quickly is a competitive advantage. |
| Delivery | Deliver working software frequently | Use iterations to break project into regular deadlines. Planning before each iteration is a chance to react to changes. |
| Working Together | Face-to-face communication is the most effective way to convery information | Written documentation is useful for information we need to retrieve later. Face-to-face is the most effective way to exchange + develop ideas. Important information is also more likely to be remembered this way.|
| Working Together | Developers and non-developers should work together daily | Non-developers have important knowledge about what the business needs. Having them involved means we catch problems ASAP and increases trust between  functions. |
| Working Together | Build projects around motivated individuals | Give them the support they need and trust them to get the job done. The team is collectively responsible for software delivered. Avoid Cover-Your-Ass behaviors like "I did my part, if the project fails so be it" |
| Execution | Working software is the primary measure of progress | This is better than a status report. Software delivered should speak for itself. Iterative approach means we should have something to show often |
| Execution | Agile processes promote sustainable development and maintainable software | Team plans in small chunks that are easier to estimate. This leads to realistic deadlines and less crunch. Also leads to less unecessary code as we only implement what is needed next => easier to maintain. |
| Execution | Continuous attention to good design enhances agility | Using design patterns and fixing design/impementation issues when we find them makes software easier to maintian and extend. This leads to faster delivery. |
| Improving | Simplicity is essential | Maximize the amount of work not done. Keep solutions as simple as possible to avoid unecessary work + complex software. Team can use planning at each iteration to identify unnecessary work. |
| Improving | The best designs emerge from self-organizing teams | Self-organizing means full team is responsible for conception, design, project management and implementation. This allows problems to be caught at all stages by team members with different information/perspective. |
| Improving | Refularly reflect on how to be more effective | After each iteration or project completion is a good time to do this. Blame-free reflection leads to a constantly improvng team. Motivation is higher since the team has ownershp over their evolution + success. |
