Material relating to how to effectively manage an engineering team:

## [Agile](agile.md)

This is my preferred approach to software development. This is how modern software is produced and a modern engineering manager is expected to know and use this.

Agile can:
- guide how we manage a team
- leads to adopting a certain philosophy/culture
- also involves adopting a set of practices (standups, retros, etc) based on this philosophy
- informs how we:
    - do project management
    - design and ship software
    - which processes we adopt

I've organised my notes on agile [here](agile.md)
