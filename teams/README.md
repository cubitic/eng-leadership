Material relating to how to effectively manage an engineering team:

## [Agile](agile.md)

Agile is a development philosophy that emphasizes "selg-organizing" teams. These teams collectively own the requirements, design and implementation of software. Contrast this with a traditional "command and control" approach where 1 person writes and owns a detailed plan.

This is my preferred approach to software development. This is how modern software is produced and a modern engineering manager is expected to know and use this.

I've organised my notes on agile [here](agile.md)

and have some separate notes on Scrum (a specific approach to agile) [here](scrum.md)

## OKRs
(WIP)
- what are these?
- why do we use them?
