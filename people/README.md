 # Giving Feedback with SBI 
 
 SBI is a framework for giving effective feedback that is designed to make the feedback clear and actionable while removing subjectiveness and preventing you from wrongly inferring intent.

 Feedback is unlikely to be received well when it is:
 - a judgment on character ("I think you are arrogant ...")
 - wrongly inferring intent ("I don't like that you tried to exclude me by ...")

The SBI approach structures feedback into 3 parts:
- Situation 
- Behavior
- Impact

You state clearly and specifically the **situation** you are referring to, describe the **behavior** that the person displayed and then the **impact** it had on you or others.

E.g.

> Today in the team meeting, when you said that my request was a waste of time, it made me feel undervalued

Phrased like this the feedback is specific + actionable and focused on the impact it had rather than being a value judgment about the person. It is more likely that this feedback is internalized by the other person because it feels less like an attack and focuses on your feelings rather than their behavior.
 

# 1-1s 
 
 1-1s are an important part of engineering management. My philosophy for these meetings is that they are the time in which the report can bring any problem or topic they want for discussion. I try to cover all of their topics first before moving to anything I have if we have time.

## Frequency

I aim to meet people bi-weekly, but adapt the schedule depending on the person. Some people will want to meet more frequently (e.g. if they are dealing with a hard situation, or a new role) and others less frequently. I trust the person to be able to decide on a frequency that makes sense.

## Topics

Typical things that are covered are:

- Project updates (I personally don't think this is the best use of the time, but often this is the topic)
- Interpersonal problems
- Career development
- Information about the business / other teams
- Future projects
- Training or learning

## Approach

I try to approach 1-1s as an opportunity for coaching.

Coaching is when someone (usually a manager) works with someone to help give them the right tools/knowledge to make them successful.

This usually involves the coachee bringing a problem or a topic and then the coach asking questions and listening. It is not a chance to give feedback, the coaches role is to listen and try to challenge any habitual reasoning or behavior (e.g. "I can't be successful at this because I don't know how to do X")

[The Coaching Habit](https://boxofcrayons.com/the-coaching-habit-book/) boils down coaching to 7 questions that you can make a habit of asking in order to operate in "coaching mode"

The ones that stick with me are:
- **What's on you mind?** as a opening question to try to find the most important problem the person is dealing with.
- **How can I help?** to try to force myself not to offer solutions

## Active Listening

[Active listening](https://www.mindtools.com/CommSkll/ActiveListening.htm) is a useful tool in 1-1s, the mental model I have of this is:

- listen intently, don't think about what you will say next
- show that you are listening (nod, say yes etc)
- when the person finishes, paraphrase what they have said to check you understood
  - "let me check I got that, so you are saying that you think this project is totally blocked and will not be delivered on time"

Benefits I feel when I communicate this way:
- forces you to listen
- makes the other person feel heard
- reduces misunderstandings because you get to confirm things


# Task Relevent Maturity

I believe that it's important to adapt you management style to individuals. [Task Relevant Maturity](https://getlighthouse.com/blog/management-concept/) is a model for doing this that says you should adapt your level of monitoring, direction, feedback etc to the experience the indidivual has with the specific task they are performing.

This is different to adapting your style to the general experience of the person. 

e.g. if someone is an excellent applied scientist, but working on implementing an Airflow DAG for the first time, they may need extra support while working on this task (more regular check-ins, ideation, review etc)
